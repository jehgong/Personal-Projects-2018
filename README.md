A physically-based renderer utilizing raytracing algorithm with OpenGL, using ray-scene  intersection, Bounding Volume Hierarchies, and irradiance sampling. Features recursive Global Illumination algorithm with Russian roulette for ray termination for realistic lighting,  and custom microfacet models with importance sampling of BRDF.
